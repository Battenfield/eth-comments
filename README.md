# ETH-Comments
A recursive Reddit-like comment container using React. With Upvote/Downvote feature, allowing the user to only vote once per comment.


### Additional Feature: Give ETH 
Allows user to tip the commenter Comment Gold(.001 ETH).
An Ethereum icon will render next to the commenter username if the user is logged into MetaMask & the commenter has an Ethereum address in the USERS data set. The user can click this icon to open MetaMask to generate and send a tx to the commenters address.
